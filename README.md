# ALX Listing App

ALX Listing App is a modern web application inspired by Airbnb. It allows users to view and explore property listings, providing an engaging and user-friendly interface for showcasing properties.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a responsive, scalable, and visually appealing listing page. Key focuses include practicing component-based design, ensuring reusable code, and leveraging modern front-end development techniques.

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **`components/`**  
  This directory contains reusable React components used across the application. Examples include `Card`, `Navbar`, and `Footer` components. Each component is designed to be modular and maintainable.

- **`interfaces/`**  
  This directory stores TypeScript interfaces and types, ensuring strong typing and better development practices. It defines the structure of data used across the application.

- **`constants/`**  
  This directory holds static values such as API endpoints, application settings, and configuration variables. It centralizes constants for easier management.

- **`public/assets/`**  
  This directory contains static assets such as images, icons, and other media files required by the application.
